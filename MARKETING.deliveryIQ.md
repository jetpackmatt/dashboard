# Delivery IQ

## Know Before Your Customer Does

---

## The Problem

Every day, packages go missing. Customers get anxious. They email. They call. They leave bad reviews. And by the time you find out, it's already a crisis.

Lost packages cost e-commerce brands more than refunds. They cost trust.

---

## The Solution

**Delivery IQ watches every package, so you don't have to.**

We monitor your shipments in real-time, detect problems before they become complaints, and tell you exactly when to act—and when to wait.

At its core is **Scout**—our AI-powered prediction engine that identifies at-risk shipments before a human ever could.

---

## How It Works

### 1. Continuous Monitoring

Every shipment. Every carrier scan. Every silence. Scout tracks it all, automatically, 24/7. We pull data from carriers in real-time and compare against historical patterns.

### 2. Proactive Risk Detection

Scout analyzes each shipment's journey and assigns risk levels. It considers:
- How long the package has been silent
- Whether it's moving toward or away from the destination
- Seasonal patterns (holiday congestion, weather events)
- Carrier-specific behavior patterns

When something looks wrong, Scout flags it—before the customer even notices.

### 3. Intelligent Recommendations

Not every delayed package is lost. Scout has learned from your actual delivery history to distinguish between:
- **Normal delays** — The package will arrive, just late
- **Warning signs** — Worth monitoring, might need action
- **Likely lost** — Time to file a claim or reship

## Scout: The Delivery Intelligence Engine

### Predictive Intelligence That Spots Problems First

Scout is Jetpack's proprietary delivery intelligence engine—**powered by AI** to detect issues with each package proactively, before a human could identify the problem.

For every package, Scout answers one simple question:

> "What's the probability this package will be delivered?"

Not a guess. Not a rule-based flag. A real probability calculated from patterns in thousands of similar shipments.

---

### How Scout Works

**Scout learns from your outcomes.** Every delivered package and every lost package teaches the system. We extract patterns from a full year of historical data.

**Time-in-state analysis.** Scout doesn't just look at what scan happened—it measures how long. A package at a hub for 2 days? Scout knows that's normal. The same package at the same hub for 8 days? Scout flags it as concerning.

**Survival analysis.** We use the same statistical methodology used by medical researchers and actuaries. For every combination of carrier, location, season, and route type, Scout has computed probability curves showing delivery likelihood over time.

**Risk factor modeling.** Scout has learned which factors increase loss risk:
- Exception scans increase risk by ~40%
- Backward movement increases risk by ~50%
- Peak season (Nov-Jan) increases risk by 15-30%

These aren't arbitrary numbers—they're coefficients learned from actual outcomes.

**Plain language summaries** that explain where your package is and whether you should worry.

**Real probabilities** based on how similar packages actually performed—not rules, not guesses.

**Confidence indicators** that tell you when we have strong data vs. limited samples.

---

## Automated Claims

When a package is truly lost, we make filing easy:

1. **Automatic detection** — Scout identifies when a package crosses from "delayed" to "likely lost" based on carrier behavior and historical patterns
2. **Automatic eligibility** — When a carrier admits loss ("Unable to Locate"), Scout immediately flags the shipment as claim-ready
3. **Optimal timing** — Scout knows the filing windows for each carrier and alerts you at the right time

No more spreadsheets. No more manual tracking. No more missed deadlines.

---

## The Intelligence Behind Scout

### Survival Analysis

We model delivery as a survival problem: "Given this package has been in this state for N days, what's the probability it will eventually be delivered?"

For every combination of carrier, scan state, season, and route, Scout has computed these curves from a full year of historical data.

### Continuous Learning

Scout improves every day:
- **Daily:** Survival curves recomputed from latest outcomes
- **Weekly:** Risk factor coefficients updated
- **Permanently:** Every new tracking event format is learned and cached

The system gets smarter as your shipping volume grows.
